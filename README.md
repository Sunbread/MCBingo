Let's play Bingo in Minecraft!

## What is MCBingo?

MCBingo is a minigame plugin for 1.13+ Minecraft Spigot servers.

In the game, players collect items and mark them on the Bingo Card - a shared card for a game. When a player marked an item on the card and the items get arranged in a row, column or diagonal, the player wins.

## Getting Started

If you don't want to compile the plugin yourself, there are [releases](https://github.com/Sunbread/MCBingo/releases) on GitHub.

To make it work on your server, you want to get the plugin and put it in the "plugins" folder of your server.

## Commands

Type "/bingo help" for a list of commands.

## Permissions

- **mcbingo.reload** - Allows to reload the config. OPs have this permission by default.
