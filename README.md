Let's play Bingo in Minecraft!

## What is MCBingo?

MCBingo is a minigame plugin for 1.13+ Minecraft Spigot servers.

In the game, players collect items and mark them on a Bingo Card. When a player's items on the card get arranged in a line (as row, column or diagonal), the player wins.

## Getting Started

If you don't want to compile the plugin yourself, there are [releases](https://github.com/Sunbread/MCBingo/releases) on GitHub.

To make it work on your server, you want to get the plugin and put it in the "plugins" folder of your server.

## Permissions

- **mcbingo.play** - Allows to play the game. Players have this permission by default.
- **mcbingo.reload** - Allows to reload the config. OPs have this permission by default.
